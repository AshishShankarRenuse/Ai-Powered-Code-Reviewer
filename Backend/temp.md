Workspace: Collecting workspace information# Backend README

## Overview

This backend project is built using Node.js and Express.js. It provides an API endpoint to review code snippets using Google's Generative AI model.

## Project Structure

```
Backend/
    .env
    package.json
    server.js
    src/
        app.js
        controllers/
            ai.controller.js
        routes/
            ai.routes.js
        services/
            ai.service.js
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the Backend directory.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Create a .env file with your Google Gemini API key:
   ```properties
   GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Running the Server

Start the server:
```sh
npm start
```
The server will listen on port 3000.

## Routes

### POST /ai/get-review

- **Description**: This endpoint accepts a code snippet and returns a review.
- **Request Body**: JSON object with a `code` key.
- **Response**: A detailed review of the provided code snippet.

## Packages and Functions

### Dependencies

- **express**: A web framework for Node.js to create the server and handle routing.
- **cors**: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing the frontend to communicate with the backend.
- **dotenv**: Loads environment variables from a .env file into `process.env`.
- **@google/generative-ai**: A package to interact with Google's Generative AI models.

### Files and Functions

- **server.js**: Entry point of the application. It loads environment variables and starts the server.
- **src/app.js**: Sets up the Express application, including middleware and routes.
- **src/routes/ai.routes.js**: Defines the `/ai/get-review` route and links it to the controller.
- **src/controllers/ai.controller.js**: Handles the logic for the `/get-review` endpoint. It validates the request and calls the service to get the review.
- **src/services/ai.service.js**: Interacts with the Google Generative AI model to generate the code review.

## Usage

1. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/ai/get-review` with a JSON body containing the `code` key.
2. Receive a detailed review of the provided code snippet.

Example request:
```json
{
  "code": "function sum(a, b) { return a + b; }"
}
```

Example response:
```json
{
  "review": "..."
}
```

This backend service leverages Google's Generative AI to provide insightful code reviews, ensuring code quality, best practices, and performance optimizations.
